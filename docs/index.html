					<p>From doing a creative degree (and finding the most joy in working with publishing software),
					I started to learn a lot about Wordpress and Google's Blogger CMS, and even started running my own website about PC Gaming on a budget.</p>
					<p>The problem was I was constantly fighting the interface to get it to look how I wanted. For a while, I stuck with trying to work within an obviously
					restricted system (Wordpress is great, but not for the things I wanted it to do &#8212; for my budget at the time.)</p>
					<p>I knew that if I wanted to make websites and create content the way I wanted to reach people, I would have to create my own platform.</p>
					<p>... turns out, much to one Italian plumber's delight, that I love making platforms!</p>
					<h2 class="t-padding sub-heading"><span class="orange">Why</span> I Got Here</h1>
					<p>The more my comedy group gained in popularity, the more we talked about getting our website professionally done. I took up the mantle
					and decided I would teach myself to code to the required standard.</p>
					<p>Building the first draft of that website was frustrating, painfully slow and made me realise just <i>how much</i> of a mountain I had to climb.</p>
					<p>It was also incredibly fun. Who knows, perhaps I'm one of those masochistic types that gets a kick out of <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code>.</p>
					<p>Anyway, that website has since undergone a revision, and I have yet another revision planned for it in the near future, after taking an online 
					<a href="https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow/learn/v4/">course</a>.</p>
					<h2 class="t-padding sub-heading"><span class="orange">Where</span> I want to go</h1>
					<p>I want to gain further experience and a firm grounding in the field through learning from other developers, as well as in my own time.
					Then, I'm looking towards app development. <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> is next on my list.</p>
